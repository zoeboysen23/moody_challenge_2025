# Python code for the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025
This repository is for the team Ephemeris Labs and is in collaboration with Zoe Boysen and Ron Yang. 
Our submission uses the provided [Challenge website](https://physionetchallenges.org/2025/#data) training database on the TensorFlow machine learning model. The model when given a 12-lead ECG recording, provides a binary Chagas label and a probability of a positive Chagas case.
